# About

I'm Kartik Manimuthu, an Architect by profession and a tech enthusiast by passion. With a diverse skillset encompassing cloud cost optimization, multi-tenant architecture, performance engineering, and serverless architecture, my experience has seen me navigate complex infrastructural and operational challenges in technology-driven environments.

As an Engineering Manager at Scrut Automation, I led a multi-faceted team of 21, including platform engineers, DevOps, and QA specialists. We implemented multi-region and multi-zone AWS strategies, and optimized SAAS release processes for faster market deployment. Before that, as a Principal Architect at BYJU'S, I honed my skills in defining and meeting business metrics, as well as resolving priority incidents. My optimizations of AWS usage resulted in significant cost savings, reduced production incidents by 70%, and I spearheaded the scaling of infrastructure to handle significant traffic influx during high-profile events.

I've overseen and executed several high-impact projects, like 'Post Call Analytics' for BYJU's, and the 'Scrut Platform' for Scrut Automation, which greatly enhanced the operations of these organizations. I strongly believe in the power of teamwork and my leadership contributed to the growth of the NextGen Team to 18 dedicated members.

I bring a strong skillset across a range of areas including Technical Leadership, Cloud Cost Optimization, Multi-Tenant Architecture, Serverless Architecture, and Data Engineering. I am adept in the MERN Stack, Golang, ETL/ELT processes, and AWS, among other technologies.

Let's explore how my technical expertise can contribute to your organization's technological advancement.

Feel free to reach out to me. I'm always open for professional discourse.
