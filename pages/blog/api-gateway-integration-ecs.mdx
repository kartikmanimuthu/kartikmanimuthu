## AWS API Gateway Integration with ECS (Fargate): A Comprehensive Analysis

When venturing into AWS's extensive suite of services, it's imperative to grasp the integration dynamics between its various components. In this piece, let's dissect the intricate relationship between AWS API Gateway and ECS, focusing on their advantages, limitations, and bottlenecks.

## Case Study 1: API Gateway v1 (Rest) with ECS via Private Link & NLB

### üåü Strengths:

- Perfect for microservice-based setups.
- Efficiently offloads authentication to Lambda, managing it at the gateway layer.
- Global CORS handling.
- Unified approach to Rate Limiting for DDoS protection.

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Limitations:

- Extra network hop through the load balancer.
- Restrictive timeout of 30 seconds.
- Soft limit set at 10,000 requests for throttling.
- Maximum allowable request payload is 10MB.

### üåü Strengths:

- Bypasses unnecessary network hops with direct integration to the ALB.
- Granular DDoS mitigation with route-specific Rate Limiting.
- Positions as a streamlined and cost-effective version of the API Gateway v1.

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Limitations:

- Lacks WAF support.
- No provision for API Key-based management.

### üîç Potential Hiccups:

- Risk of timeouts for endpoints with latencies above 30 seconds.
- Challenging scenarios with API payloads surpassing 10MB.

### üõ† Ways to Overcome:

- Endeavor to keep endpoint responses within optimal SLAs, ideally under 5 seconds.
- Pivoting from synchronous to asynchronous API calls.
- Redirect file uploads to utilize presigned S3 bucket links.
