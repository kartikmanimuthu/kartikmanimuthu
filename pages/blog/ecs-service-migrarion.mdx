## Effortless Migration of AWS ECS Service Using a Shell Script

In the vast realm of AWS, migrating resources, especially ECS Fargate Tasks, can often seem daunting. Our solution? A dynamic shell script that not only facilitates the transfer of these tasks but also optimizes costs using Fargate Spot.

## Why This Script Matters

Transitioning between AWS clusters requires precision and coordination. Our script aims to:

- **Simplify Migration**: Seamlessly transfer Service from source to destination clusters.
- **Replicate with Precision**: Maintain service configurations consistently across clusters.
- **Offer Peace of Mind**: By monitoring task health, ensuring successful migration before any cleanup.

## Visualize the Process

To help visualize the migration journey:

```
          +----------------------------------------+
          |            Source Cluster              |
          |                                        |
          |   +---------------------+              |
          |   |      ECS Service    |              |
          |   +---------------------+              |
          |       |               |                |
          |       v               |                |
          |   +---------------------+              |
          |   |   Service    |              |
          |   +---------------------+              |
          |                                        |
          +----------------------------------------+

          +----------------------------------------+
          |          Destination Cluster           |
          |                                        |
          |   +---------------------+              |
          |   |      ECS Service    |              |
          |   +---------------------+              |
          |       |               |                |
          |       v               |                |
          |   +---------------------+              |
          |   |   Service    |              |
          |   +---------------------+              |
          |                                        |
          +----------------------------------------+
```

## Quick Setup & Run

### Essential Tools:

- **AWS CLI**: Ensure it's installed and ready with appropriate permissions.
- **`jq`**: Required for JSON parsing.

### Kickstart the Migration:

1. **Clone** : [Source Code â†—](https://github.com/kartikmanimuthu/aws-ecs-workshop)

2. **Initialize**:

   - `SERVICE_NAME`: Your ECS service's name.
   - `SOURCE_CLUSTER`: Source's cluster name.
   - `DEST_CLUSTER`: Destination's cluster name.

3. **Trigger**:
   ```bash
   bash ecs-service-migration.sh
   ```

## What to Expect

- **Regular Updates**: The script will keep you informed with relevant migration updates.
- **Safety First**: Before any deletions on the source cluster, the script ensures tasks on the destination cluster are healthy.
- **Resilience**: If any tasks face health issues, the script retries, ensuring maximum chances for a successful migration.

## Final Thoughts

While automation simplifies tasks, being informed and cautious is key. Always review script settings and configurations prior to execution to safeguard your AWS ECS infrastructure.

Stay innovative and happy migrating!
