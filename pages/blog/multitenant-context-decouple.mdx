## MultiTenant Context Decoupling: A Node.js Solution

Modern software design, especially within the realm of **SaaS applications**, frequently embraces multitenancy. This concept, though advantageous, introduces the complexity of managing each **tenant's context**. Particularly when asynchronous operations come into play, handling context can be a puzzle. This article unpacks a novel approach to this challenge, capitalizing on Express.js and Node.js's `async_hooks` module.

## The Challenge

Layered architecture designs, especially those crafted with Node.js, commonly need to integrate **tenantId** or corresponding identifiers across various layers. The main hurdle is the consistent management of the tenant context over asynchronous tasks, eliminating the need to tediously pass the context across every layer.

## Introducing `async_hooks`: The Game Changer

Node.js's `async_hooks` module offers an API to register callbacks, precisely tracing the lifespan of asynchronous resources. By harnessing the capabilities of this intrinsic module, developers can adeptly manage and preserve the tenant context throughout asynchronous tasks.

## A Visual Dive into the Architecture

For those who prefer a visual insight, the subsequent diagrams detail how the tenant context is preserved throughout an application's operations:
