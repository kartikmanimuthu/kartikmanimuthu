### BYJU's Post Call Analytics (PCA)

**Description** :

Harnessing the power of AI/ML and NLP, the PCA system revolutionized call auditing. This in-house tool enables an 80% audit coverage of a massive 120K daily calls using only 2 personnel, compared to the previous 7% coverage with 20 members. Beyond efficiency, PCA offers real-time customer sentiment analysis, instantly detects false promises by agents, and provides data-driven agent ratings. This ensures enhanced customer trust, reduced sales escalations, and an overall optimized feedback loop.
